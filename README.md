## About
Quizzle is a simple quiz application which features interactivity through use of the JavaScript programming language. The purpose of the website is to challenge users to take part in a multiple-choice quiz where they can select an answer and then find out their score at the end of the quiz. The quiz utilises a randomness element to ensure replayability by pulling from a pool of questions.

The deployed version of the site can be accessed on GitHub Pages [here.](https://morgana-s.github.io/quizzle/)
